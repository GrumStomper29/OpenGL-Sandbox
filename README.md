# OpenGL-Sandbox
Sandbox for experimenting with 3D graphics programming techniques.

## Building
Requires Visual Studio. Simply open the solution (.sln) file and compile the project!

## Usage
The assets folder must contain a "Bistro1.glb" and "cubes.glb". The content of these files doesn't matter, provided that there is some opaque geometry and some alpha-blended geometry.

Use WASDEQ to move. Rotate with the arrow keys.
